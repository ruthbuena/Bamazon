Bamazon

In this Repository, users have the ability to create and maintain a marketplace using Node.js and MySQL.

In Part I, a database (bamazon) has been created using MySQL to keep track of inventory.  The Id number, product name, department name, price and stock quantity for each product will be maintained in the bamazon database.  Node application (bamazonCustomer.js) has been created to allow customers to purchase items based on availability.  The bamazon database will be updated after purchases are completed.
